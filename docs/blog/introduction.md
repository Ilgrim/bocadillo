As far as news, announcements and release notes are concerned, Bocadillo's main communication channel so far has been our Twitter account, [@bocadillopy](https://twitter.com/bocadillopy).

I think setting up that account relatively early was a very good decision in terms of giving Bocadillo an online presence. For sure, the developer community is particularly active on Twitter, and @bocadillopy has been gaining momentum recently â€” which is great!

All that said, Twitter as a news platform has its limitations. Not everyone's there, the amount of copy is limited (even with threads), and â€” most importantly â€” the content tends to get lost in the sea, and hard to discover.

That's why, in order to reach out to people outside the Twitter sphere, I thought it would be a good idea to set up a simple blog where you could find all things related to Bocadillo news, releases and announcements. We'll probably be cross-posting these posts to our account on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/bocadillo), too.

Breaking Bread is going to be Bocadillo's central place for announcements, release notes, news, but also blog-friendly learning material. The expression "breaking bread" can be understood metaphorically as "sharing" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_bread)), so that's exactly what we'll be doing over here.

We hope you enjoy the blog posts you'll find here as much as we'll enjoy writing them! ðŸ™Œ
