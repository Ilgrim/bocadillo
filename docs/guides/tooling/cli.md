# CLI

To help you build Bocadillo applications faster and automate common tasks, we built **Queso**, a zero-config, extensible and familiar CLI built on top of [Click].

::: tip CHANGED IN v0.11.0
Our CLI now ships as a separate package.

Documentation is available at <queso text="Queso: Tasty development tooling for Bocadillo"/>.
