# Error handling

## How exceptions are handled

WebSocket routes do not have advanced error handling mechanisms similar to those available for HTTP routes.

The only thing that Bocadillo does is ensuring that the client receives a 1011 (Internal Error) close event if an exception is raised on the server. This is done by catching exceptions raised in the view and closing the WebSocket before re-raising the exception for further server-side processing.

The only exception to this is some specific cases of [client-side connection closures](#handling-client-side-connection-closures).

## Returning errors

In the world of WebSockets, servers and clients notify one another of errors by closing the connection with an appropriate **close code**. This means that the canonical way of returning an error is to `close()` with an appropriate `code` as argument.

> Which `code` should I use, then?

The [CloseEvent] reference page lists WebSocket close codes and their meaning. In particular:

- Standard codes in the **1000-1015 range** may be useful. We provide a dictionary of these in the [constants] module.
- You should use the **4000-4999 range** for returning errors whose meaning is application-specific. This range is indeed reserved for application use by the WebSocket standard.

## Handling client-side connection closures

When the client disconnects while we are trying to `receive()` a message, a `WebSocketDisconnect` exception is raised.

This exception is automatically caught (and silenced) if all these conditions are met:

- The exception is raised within a WebSocket context (i.e. when using the `async with` syntax).
- The close code is 1000 (Normal Closure) or 1001 (Going Away), both being considered successful closure codes.

In other cases, you will need to handle the exception yourself. A typical situation is expecting to receive a 1006 (Abnormal Closure) close code which may be sent by some web browsers when a user closes a page that maintains a WebSocket connection with your server.

::: tip
You can customize which close codes are caught within the WebSocket context by passing a tuple of integers to the `caught_close_codes` parameter of `@app.websocket_route()`. The `all` Python built-in can be passed to catch all close codes. To not catch any close code, pass the empty tuple `()`.
